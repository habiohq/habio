# RFC 0003: Observation and Verification

- Status: Accepted
- Authors: Habio maintainers
- Created: 2026-09-06
- Related issues: #4

## Summary

Treat Observation as timestamped, source-attributed evidence and Verification
as a named policy's immutable assessment of one Action against observations at
an explicit evaluation time.

## Motivation

Provider state can be stale, indirect, delayed, or inconsistent with an
independent sensor. A command acknowledgement is not proof of the desired
effect. Habio needs to retain evidence and identify the policy that judged it.

## Proposal

Observation contains opaque identity, source, logical target, value, optional
source evidence, ObservedAt, and RecordedAt. Values and evidence are bytes owned
by the Observation. ObservedAt represents the source clock; RecordedAt
represents Habio ingestion. Clock skew is preserved rather than silently
corrected.

Freshness is not a boolean stored on Observation because freshness depends on
the action, verifier, and evaluation time. Verifier receives an explicit `asOf`
time and decides whether evidence is fresh enough.

VerificationResult is unknown, verified, unsatisfied, or inconclusive. A
non-unknown result records verifier identity, check time, observation IDs, and
a diagnostic reason. Inconclusive covers missing, stale, contradictory, or
otherwise insufficient evidence. Reason is not a control-flow API.

Verifier is a one-method extension contract. Concrete comparison, tolerance,
safety, and freshness policy stays outside core.

## Alternatives

### Treat provider state as truth

This cannot express stale caches, indirect evidence, or conflicting sensors.
Rejected.

### Store `Fresh bool`

Freshness changes with evaluation time and policy, so a stored boolean becomes
stale itself. Rejected.

### One timestamp

Using only ingestion time overstates freshness when a provider returns an old
state. Using only source time hides delivery delay. Both are retained.

### Boolean verification

True/false cannot distinguish contradictory evidence from missing or stale
evidence. Rejected.

### Put Verify on Provider

Observation and verification can use independent sources and policies. The
contracts remain separate.

## Drawbacks

Opaque values require extension-specific decoding. Source clocks can be wrong,
so Verifiers must explicitly handle future observations and skew. Observation
IDs add persistence and correlation work for runtimes.

## Open questions

- Do conformance formats need media types or schemas for Value and Evidence?
- How should a projection expose multiple simultaneous verifier results?
- When should contradictory observations create an explicit conflict fact?
- Does verifier identity require a separate version field?

## Decision

Accepted for v0.1. Evidence remains immutable and source-attributed. Freshness
and desired-effect semantics remain explicit Verifier policy.
